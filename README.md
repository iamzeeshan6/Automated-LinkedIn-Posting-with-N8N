# Automated-LinkedIn-Posting-with-N8N
Automated n8n workflow that checks Google Sheets for unposted content, generates LinkedIn posts using OpenAI agents, and automatically publishes them on LinkedIn.

This repository contains an n8n automation workflow that monitors a Google Sheet for new or unposted content ideas. When a new row is detected, the workflow sends the title to an AI agent powered by OpenAI, generates a polished LinkedIn post, and automatically publishes it to LinkedIn, creating a fully hands-off content generation and posting system.
